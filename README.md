## What do I do in my free time?
Recently, I have been using this discord bot called [<ins>Ticketon</ins>](https://ticketon.app). This bot is **top-tier**, I recommend checking it out, the developer is also very nice too! 

I will read through the [<ins>Ticketon Bot Documents</ins>](https://docs.ticketon.app) and try to find mistakes or stuff I can add on to. Then I'll fork the page's repository and edit the page before making a pull request. 

It's suprisingly relaxing to do this, I have no idea why :thinking:.
